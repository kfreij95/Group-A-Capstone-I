## Welcome to Team "Epigenomics" GitHub Page <br>
Our team's interests center on the analysis of epigenomic and genomic datasets.  Thus, we are interested in analyzing a variety of large datasets, often derived from next generation sequencing.  These datasets include RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RRBS data, and more.  [Managing this variety of datasets and formats](https://github.com/kfreij95/Group-A-Capstone-I/blob/main/Data-Files/datafilesreadme.md), as well as the analysis pipelines needed is something we hope to use the tools provided by Cyverse for.

## Lessons learned from FOSS <br>
Reflections from our group members on on tools or concepts learned through FOSS and how we might apply them to their field of study. Specifically, we address the following questions:<br>
    - Which tool could you apply right away and why?<br>
    - What is your greatest barrier to these tools?<br>
    - What tools would you wish we covered more in depth?<br>

The discussions about data management, data integrity, and FAIR data standards have been very useful. I have been able to incorporate these ideas into a data management plan for a grant to be submitted this spring.  In addition, I have made more conscious decisions on how to handle data, file naming, etc for a new project that we just started in the lab.  Applying these concepts will help me encourage my laboratory to strive to meet FAIR data standards and apply Open Science principles whenever possible.  In terms of computational tools, I would like to use Cyverse to develop and implement shared data analysis pipelines for genomics data analysis to have one standard for all lab personnel and to prevent having multiple parallel pipelines implemented by different people.  To achieve that, I need to big deeper into the tools provided by Cyverse to do that, learn about pipeline managers and Docker.  For me, the main barrier is lack of time.
