## Welcome to Team "Epigenomics" GitHub Page <br>
Our team's interest center on the analysis of epigenomic and genomic datasets.  Thus, we are interested in analyzing a variety of large datasets, often derived from next generation sequencing.  These datasets include RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RRBS data, and more.  [Managing this variety of datasets and formats](https://github.com/kfreij95/Group-A-Capstone-I/blob/main/Data-Files/datafilesreadme.md), as well as the analysis pipelines needed is something we hope to use the tools provided by Cyverse for.
