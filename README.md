## Welcome to Team "Epigenomics" GitHub Page

Our team's interest center on the analysis of epigenomic and genomic datasets.  Thus, we are interested in analyzing a variety of large datasets, often derived from next generation sequencing.  These datasets include RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RRBS data, and more.  Managing this variety of datasets and formats, as well as the analysis pipelines needed is something we hope to use the tools provided by Cyverse for.

## Data Management Plan
<br>
**- List out steps and how we plan to perform each in the project section**
The data files will be stored in [compiled datasets]() with [laboratory notes]() stored in a concise manner. The titles of FASTA and other files used in the analysis correspond to the stored title seen in the [data files](). 

The experimental data generated by the labs follow the title structure: YYYY-MM-DD Tissue-Type Structure-of-Interest Analysis-Type. The name of the machine used can be found within the file as well as the lab running the analysis. These will be in the top cells of the CSV files.
