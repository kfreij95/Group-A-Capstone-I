## Data Management Plan <br>
The data files will be stored in [compiled datasets](https://github.com/kfreij95/Group-A-Capstone-I/tree/main/Data-Files) with [laboratory notes]() stored in a concise manner. The titles of FASTA and other files used in the analysis correspond to the stored title seen in the data files. 

The experimental data generated by the labs follow the title structure: YYYY-MM-DD Tissue-Type Structure-of-Interest Analysis-Type. The name of the machine used can be found within the file as well as the lab running the analysis. These will be in the top cells of the CSV files.
